## Short-term improvements ✅
Here are some ideas for short-term improvements and enhancements that I can consider for this Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project:

- Comparative Analysis: I'll extend my analysis to include in this analysis more comparative insights.
- Dashboard Creation: I can build a dashboard using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Dash/Plotly to present the analysis interactively and share it with a wider audience.

These improvements will enhance the quality and depth of the analysis and provide more valuable insights for the audience.
